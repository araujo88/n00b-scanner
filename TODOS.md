# TODOs

1. **Multithreading**: Implement multithreading to scan multiple ports simultaneously. This will significantly speed up the scanning process.

2. **User-Defined Port Range**: Allow the user to specify a range of ports to scan instead of scanning all 65535 ports. This can save time and focus on more relevant ports.

3. **Improved Error Handling**: Enhance the error handling to differentiate between different types of socket errors, such as connection refused, no route to host, etc.

4. **Timeouts**: Implement a timeout for socket connections. This will prevent the program from hanging on ports that don't respond quickly.

5. **Verbose Mode**: Add an option for verbose output, which provides more detailed information about each attempt, such as time taken, response received, etc.

6. **Banner Grabbing**: Optionally, implement banner grabbing to gather more information about open ports, such as the service or software running on them.

7. **IPv6 Support**: Add support for IPv6 addresses to make the scanner more versatile.

8. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to control the number of requests sent per second. This can prevent network congestion and reduce the likelihood of being detected and blocked by firewalls.

9. **Logging**: Add functionality to log results to a file for later analysis.

10. **Command-Line Argument Parsing**: Use a more robust library for command-line argument parsing, like `getopt`, for better usability and error checking.

11. **Randomized Port Scanning**: Instead of scanning ports sequentially, randomly scan ports to make the scanning activity less predictable and harder to detect.

12. **User-Agent Spoofing**: If the program expands to handle more complex scanning (like HTTP requests), implementing user-agent spoofing can help bypass basic security filters.

13. **Legal Disclaimer**: Include a legal disclaimer or warning at the start of the program to inform users about the legal and ethical implications of port scanning.

14. **Configuration File Support**: Allow users to specify options and parameters in a configuration file, making it easier to run with complex setups.

15. **Interactive Mode**: Add an interactive mode where users can modify scanning parameters on the fly based on ongoing results.

Remember, any network scanning tool should be used responsibly and legally. Ensure that you have permission to scan the target network or IP address to avoid legal issues.
